# TermPlug

This is a "plugin" to preview files and videos from a terminal file manager, like ranger.

Previewing in the terminal works for some emulators but it often has drawbacks (like not working inside tmux) and is not very fast.

TermPlug is a native app that runs on top (in front of) the terminal and can preview images, videos, pdfs, etc.
